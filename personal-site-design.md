What is you site's primary purpose?

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want visitors to pop into my site and get a sense for my purpose very succintly; Communicated through the written introduction, through the design of the site and even through the background and any decorative elements.
I would like visitors to come to my site and see me; My current skills, learning/training I intend to undertake and my interests. It would also be great to have a comments section where people can discuss the site or share any tips or tricks regarding web design. 

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

It goes without saying, designing it with a 'mobile first' mindset is very important. That being said, I'd like to find a good balance between efficient loading times and having design elements that function on any device. I'd like to keep worded information as the focus without taking away too much attention from elements like the background or flexible elements that are a display of the 'mobile first' philosophy.
